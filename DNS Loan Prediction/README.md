# Installation Notes and Requirements

Please note that installing the following libraries and running code alongside is **not a hard requirement for attending the tutorial session**, you will be able to follow along just fine. The tutorial code should be compatible to Python 3.x. but will require recent installations of

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [IPython](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)
- [watermark](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watermark)

To install these libraries it's most convenient to either use [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), e.g.,

    conda install numpy

or

    pip install numpy

etc.


Please make sure that you have these libraries installed in your current Python environment prior to attending the tutorial if you want to execute the code examples that are executed during the talk.
